# nhentai-ruby-telegram-bot
This is a telegram bot written with ruby and the ruby nhentai-api and scrapping code. <br>
There is space for many improvements and refactor the code.
I just made for the meme and fun. Probably won't code nothing more.<br><br>
This bot is crashing due the nhentai-api gem requests but still working.


### Commands
